# nlp-thesis-sentiment
This repository contains the code for my NLP-based sentiment analysis on tweets, conducted for my thesis. It uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for sentiment classification. Tweet embeddings are extracted using the pre-trained cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment model before feeding them into the MLP.
